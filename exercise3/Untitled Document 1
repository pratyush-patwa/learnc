Exercise 3

HOW TO BREAK IT

CASE 1- Take the age variable out from printf 

Observation - Warning occurs %d format is not initialized hence it give a garbage value.

OUTPUT
I am 14196182	years old.
I am 72	inches tall.

CASE 2- Dont initialize the initial value while declaring variable.

OBSERVATION- NO warning during make file but prints the garbage value.

OUTPUT
I am 2850804	years old.
I am 72	inches tall.


EXTRA CREDIT..

CASE 1-Use %f instead of %d in printf statement.
 printf("I am %f years old.\n", age);

OBSERVATION- Warning: format ‘%f’ expects argument of type ‘double’, but argument 2 has type ‘int’.

OUTPUT
I am 0.000000	years old.
I am 72	inches tall.

CASE 2- Use %s instead of %d in printf statement
printf("I am %s years old.\n", age);

OBSERVATION- Warning: format ‘%s’ expects argument of type ‘char *’, but argument 2 has type ‘int’.

OUTPUT
I am |} years old.
I am 72	inches tall.

Format Characters-
d,i for int
o, u, x, X for unsigned int
e,E for doubles
f,F  for doubles
g,G double argument is converted in style f or e
a,A double argument converted to hexa decimal
c for unsigned char
s for string

CASE3- Add ex3 to our Makefile's all list. Use this to make clean all and build all your exercises so far.

CFLAGS = -Wall -g

all: ex1 ex3

clean:
    rm -rf ex1 ex1.dSYM

CASE 4- Add ex3 to our Makefile's clean list as well. Now use make clean will remove it when you need to.

CFLAGS = -Wall -g

all: ex1 ex3

clean:
    rm -rf ex1 ex1.dSYM ex3 ex3.dSYM
